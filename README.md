### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a full-time software developer, and I also do programming as a hobby.

I often work on game-related projects, especially projects using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

## Some of my projects

*Ordered by most recent to least*

## DeshanimQuest

https://github.com/hohfchns/hohfchns/assets/57037334/96d89897-0108-4812-aef8-b5a3a260b442

DeshanimQuest is my in-development game, it is a fun and cheerful RPG game, made in Godot.

## DialogueQuest

DialogueQuest is a Dialogue system for Godot, which makes it easy to create portrayals of characters speaking, thinking, etc.

The main feature of DialogueQuest is the additional software that goes along with it:

DialogueQuest has a focus on user experience, as well as documentation for both users and developers.

It features up-to-date manuals on how to use the program from both a dialogue writer perspective, as well as a developer-using-the-plugin perspective.

## DialogueQuestTester

![DIQ_Tester](https://github.com/hohfchns/hohfchns/assets/57037334/b662cf16-5ddd-45c3-a2fd-a26a97851627)

DialogueQuestTester is a standalone app that allows running DialogueQuest files without having to use it in a Godot project.

This means that designers / writers can write dialogue directly, instead of having to offload it to a programmer for implementation.
